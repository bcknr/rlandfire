## rlandfire: Tools for Accessing and Working with LANDFIRE in R

![](https://img.shields.io/github/r-package/v/bcknr/rlandfire)
\
\
`rlandfire` provides access to a diverse suite of spatial data layers via the LANDFIRE Product Services ([LFPS](https://lfps.usgs.gov/arcgis/rest/services/LandfireProductService/GPServer)) API. [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov) is a joint program of the USFS, DOI, and other major partners, which provides data layers for wildfire management, fuel modeling, ecology, natural resource management, climate, conservation, etc. The complete list of available layers and additional resources can be found on the LANDFIRE webpage.

## Installation

`rlandfire` can be installed from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("bcknr/rlandfire")
```

Set `build_vignettes = TRUE` to access this vignette in R:

``` r
devtools::install_github("bcknr/rlandfire", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

This package is still in development, and users may encounter bugs or unexpected behavior. Please report any issues, feature requests, or suggestions in the package's [GitHub repo](https://github.com/bcknr/rlandfire/issues).

## `rlandfire` vs LANDFIRE Product Service (LFPS)

## Using `rlandfire`

To demonstrate `rlandfire`, we will explore how Ponderosa Pine forest canopy cover changed after the 2020 Calwood fire near Boulder, Colorado.

```{r setup}
library(rlandfire)
library(sf)
library(terra)
```

To start, we will load in the boundary of the Calwood Fire, which I previously downloaded from Boulder County's [geospatial data hub](https://opendata-bouldercounty.hub.arcgis.com/).

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
boundary_file <- file.path(tempdir(), "Wildfire_History")
utils::unzip(system.file("extdata/Wildfire_History.zip", package = "rlandfire"),
             exdir = boundary_file)

boundary <- st_read(file.path(boundary_file, "Wildfire_History.shp")) %>% 
  sf::st_transform(crs = st_crs(32613))

plot(boundary$geometry, main = "Calwood Fire Boundary (2020)", 
     border = "red", lwd = 1.5)
```

### AOI

We can use the function `rlandfire::getAOI()` to create an area of interest (AOI) vector with the correct format for `landfireAPI()`. `getAOI()` handles several steps for us, it ensures that the AOI is returned in the correct order (`xmin`, `ymin`, `xmax`, `ymax`) and converts the AOI to latitude and longitude coordinates (required by the API) if needed.

Using the `extend` argument, we will increase the AOI by 1 km in all directions to provide additional context surrounding the burned area. This argument takes an optional numeric vector of 1, 2, or 4 elements passed to `terra::extend()`.

```{r}
aoi <- getAOI(boundary, extend = 1000)
aoi
```

### Products

We are interested in two canopy cover products, canopy cover in 2019 (`200CC_19`) and 2022 (`220CC_22`), and the existing vegetation type (`200EVT`). All available data products, and their abbreviated names, can be found in the [products table](https://lfps.usgs.gov/helpdocs/productstable.html).

```{r}
products <- c("200CC_19", "220CC_22", "200EVT")
```

### Projection and resolution

We can ask the API to project the data to the same CRS as our boundary data by providing the `WKID` for our CRS of interest and a resolution of our choosing, in meters.

```{r}
projection <- 32613
resolution <- 90
```

### Edit rule

We will use the `edit_rule` argument to filter out canopy cover data that doesn't correspond to Ponderosa Pine Woodland. To do this, we will use an `edit_rule` statement which says that when existing vegetation cover is anything other than Ponderosa Pine Woodland, the value of the canopy cover should be set to a specified value.

Specifically, we specify that when `220EVT`, the condition, is not equal (`ne`) to `7054` the canopy cover layers should be set equal (`st`) to `1`. (*There is some weird behavior with the API where clear value [`cv`] or setting the value outside of 0-100 doesn't work. So here we are using `1` since it is not found in the original data*).

```{r}
edit_rule <- list(c("condition","200EVT","ne",7054),
                  c("change", "200CC_19", "st", 1),
                  c("change", "220CC_22", "st", 1))
```

Our requested edits are a relatively simple implementation of `edit_rule`, and it is important to note that edits are limited to fuel theme products (i.e., Fire Behavior Fuel Model 13, Fire Behavior Fuel Model 40, Forest Canopy Base Height, Forest Canopy Bulk Density, Forest Canopy Cover, and Forest Canopy Height). The syntax is explained in the [LFPS guide](https://lfps.usgs.gov/helpdocs/LFProductsServiceUserGuide.pdf), and the rules are evaluated in the order they are listed.

### Path

Finally, we will provide a path to a temporary zip file. Setting the path as a temp file is not strictly necessary because if `path` is left blank `landfireAPI()` will save the data to a temporary folder by default.

```{r}
path <- tempfile(fileext = ".zip")
```

### Call `landfireAPI()`

Now we are able to submit a request to the LANDFIRE Product Services API with the `landfireAPI()` function.

```{r}
resp <- landfireAPI(products = products,
                    aoi = aoi, 
                    projection = projection, 
                    resolution = resolution,
                    edit_rule = edit_rule,
                    path = path,
                    verbose = FALSE)
```

`landfireAPI()` will download your requested data into the folder provided in the path argument. If you didn't provide one, you can find the path to your data in the `$path` element of the `landfire_api` object returned by `landfireAPI()`.

```{r}
resp$path
```

### Load and process LF data

The files returned by the LFPS API are compressed `.zip` files. We need to unzip them before reading the file ending in `.tif`. Note: all additional metadata is included in this same directory as well.

```{r}
lf_dir <- file.path(tempdir(), "lf")
utils::unzip(path, exdir = lf_dir)

lf <- terra::rast(list.files(lf_dir, pattern = ".tif$", full.names = TRUE))
```

Now we can reclassify the canopy cover layers to remove any values which are not classified as Ponderosa Pine, calculate the change, and plot.

```{r, fig.align = "center", fig.height = 5, fig.width = 7}
lf$US_200CC_19[lf$US_200CC_19 == 1] <- NA
lf$US_220CC_22[lf$US_220CC_22 == 1] <- NA

change <- lf$US_220CC_22 - lf$US_200CC_19

plot(change, col = rev(terrain.colors(250)),
     main = "Canopy Cover Loss - Calwood Fire (2020)",
     xlab = "Easting",
     ylab = "Northing")
plot(boundary$geometry, add = TRUE, col = NA,
     border = "black", lwd = 2)
```
